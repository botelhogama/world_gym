# 🏋️‍♂️ World Gym

## 📌 About the Project

**World Gym** is a fitness-oriented application designed to enhance **gym operations** by providing **management insights**, optimizing **equipment and space usage**, and improving **client engagement**. This repository contains the **backend logic, frontend components, and database integration** for managing gym clients and predicting churn.

The **primary objective** of this project is to **collect and process client information** to develop a **predictive model** that estimates the **probability of churn** for each client. Additionally, the system provides insights into:

- 📊 **Gym occupancy monitoring**
- 🏋️ **Equipment usage tracking**
- 🔄 **Client frequency control**
- 🎯 **Marketing efficiency analysis**
- 📈 **Other key management metrics**

This model is built using **Python and Scikit-Learn**, incorporating **feature engineering techniques** such as **calculating the distance between clients' homes and gyms** along with other transformations.

---

## 🎯 Features

✅ **API Integration** – Structured API for data handling and frontend-backend communication.  
✅ **Client Location Processing** – Calculate the distance from clients' homes to gyms.  
✅ **Churn Prediction Model** – Use **Scikit-Learn** to estimate the probability of client churn.  
✅ **Occupancy & Equipment Usage Monitoring** – Track real-time usage of gym spaces and equipment.  
✅ **Marketing Efficiency Analysis** – Evaluate marketing campaigns' impact on gym attendance and retention.
